# 1. Be MUCH stricter about the minimum size of a content block.
# We will ignore anything smaller than a decent-sized paragraph.
OPENCV_MIN_BLOCK_W=200

# 2. Be more aggressive about filtering based on text density.
# We will demand that a block have a higher concentration of "ink" to be considered valid.
MIN_INK_FRACTION=0.08

# 3. Reduce the number of chunks we are willing to generate from a single detected block.
# This prevents a single, noisy block from creating dozens of bad chunks.
MAX_CHUNKS_PER_BLOCK=4

# 4. Turn on the diagnostic port so we can see what the engine is doing.
